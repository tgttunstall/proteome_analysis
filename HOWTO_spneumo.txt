Retrieve a list of proteome ids from sql query into a file:
- spneumo_proteomeids.out 
SQL query files:
- spneumo_proteomeids.sql
- spneumo_biosample_info.sh

NOTE: Also ran a separate query to get the proteome ids along with the biosample ids 
- spneumo_biosample_info.out

NOTE: other files
- spneumo_biosample_info.out        
- spneumo_proteomeids.out        
- spneumo_proteomeids_public.out 

Data on on the cluster is in: /
/nfs/research/martin/uniprot/research/spneumo_dataset$ 

and temp scripts in;
/nfs/research/martin/uniprot/research/spneumo_analysis
But these should reside in ~/git/arise_proteome
